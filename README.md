## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of one year’s worth of e-commerce sales and customer behavior. The goal was to uncover actionable insights about product performance, customer loyalty, revenue trends, and returns — ultimately helping the business improve profits and retention.

The dataset was cleaned and prepared using Python, then analyzed to deliver strategic recommendations around product management, customer targeting, and market expansion.

## Key Results

### Sales & Revenue Overview
- **Gross Revenue:** $10.64M  
- **Net Revenue (after returns):** $9.75M  
- **Average Order Value:** $516.48  
- **Return Rate:** 15.69% (by orders), 4.93% (by product)  
- **Unique Customers:** 4,373 (Avg. 6 purchases each)

*Insight:* Strong revenue and order volume, but return rates are high and erode profits.

---

### Sales Trends

- **Monthly Trends:** Revenue peaks in Nov–Dec; dips in Feb & Apr.
- **Weekly Patterns:** Most orders placed Sun–Thurs. No orders on Saturdays.
- **Hourly Behavior:** Activity peaks 9AM–12PM.

*Recommendation:*  
- Run promotions during slow months  
- Test Saturday campaigns  
- Schedule marketing for peak hours (9AM–12PM)

---

### Product Performance

- Top products differ by quantity vs. revenue — pricing and returns play a role.
- Some products had **100% return rates**.
- Many items underperformed (< 5 sales in 6 months).

*Recommendation:*  
- Flag or remove high-return items  
- Reconsider stocking low-volume products  
- Adjust marketing around top performers

---

### Country-Level Insights

- **Top Revenue Countries:** UK, Netherlands, Ireland  
- **Top Order Countries:** UK, Germany, France  
- Some countries (e.g., Czech Republic, Italy) had very high return rates — mostly due to low customer counts.

*Recommendation:*  
- Focus growth in **Germany and France**  
- Ignore outlier return rates with <5 customers  
- Optimize shipping & experience in high-potential countries

---

### Customer Segmentation (RFM Analysis)

- **70%** of customers are repeat buyers
- **Champions** and **Loyal Customers** are the largest and highest-spending groups
- New customers contribute only **4.17% of revenue**

*Recommendation:*  
- Reward loyal buyers with perks and exclusive deals  
- Improve onboarding for new customers  
- Re-engage dormant/at-risk users with win-back campaigns

---

## Summary of Recommendations

- Launch campaigns during slow months (Feb, Apr)  
- Market between 9AM–12PM (peak hour)  
- Review or remove high-return and low-performance products  
- Strengthen loyalty programs for repeat customers  
- Improve new customer experience (first purchase discounts, onboarding)  
- Focus marketing in Germany & France  
- Reactivate dormant and at-risk users
